              Airport Reef is located off the island of Tutuila, the largest island in American Samoa. In this photo, the staghorn corals are healthy and abundant. But researchers returned just two months later to find the reef completely transformed by severe coral bleaching.

              Around the world, coral reefs feed and shelter thousands of species of fish, buffer coastal areas against damaging waves, and support local economies through tourism and fishing.

              This is Airport Reef off American Samoa. In 2015, many corals here lost their color in a dramatic—and destructive—stress response known as <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coral bleaching.</a></p>
            <p>
              Prolonged exposure to warmer ocean temperatures and other stressors can cause corals to expel their symbiotic algae, leaving the corals’ white skeletons visible. (These algae give corals their color and nourish them through photosynthesis.) Some corals are able to bounce back from bleaching events if water temperatures decrease fast enough. In a warming ocean, however, <a href="https://www.coralcoe.org.au/media-releases/two-thirds-of-great-barrier-reef-hit-by-back-to-back-mass-coral-bleaching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corals will have less time to recover</a> between bouts of bleaching, and widespread die-off could occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              Airport Reef wasn’t alone. During a global bleaching event that lasted from 2014 to 2017, <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/global-coral-bleaching-event-likely-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 70 percent of the world’s tropical reefs</a> experienced high ocean temperatures that lasted long enough to put them at risk of bleaching. Explore the other layers to see what Airport Reef looked like before and after this photo was taken.

                  A recent <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> found that tropical coral reefs are heading into “a new era” in which bleaching occurs too frequently for corals to bounce back. The study drew its findings from 100 tropical reefs around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, as climate change magnified thermal stress from strong El Niño events, bouts of global bleaching began to occur. The study says that the past two decades have witnessed a new trend: regional-scale bleaching even in years outside El Niño periods. (Before 1980, bleaching at a regional scale was seldom seen.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  The study found that 42% of severe bleaching events among the reefs have occurred during hot summers outside of El Niño periods. As climate change progresses, the study notes, “average tropical sea surface temperatures are warmer today under La Niña conditions than they were during El Niño events only three decades ago.”

              After the bleaching event in 2015, few healthy corals were left in Airport Reef. The algae seen here are not the symbiotic kind that usually keep company with corals, but rather a type of overgrown turf algae living on the skeletons of the dead animals.

                  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced in summer 2017 that the third global coral bleaching event <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/media-release/global-coral-bleaching-event-likely-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared to be on the wane.</a> But it’s a temporary reprieve. As this map reveals, things are set to get much worse.

                  This map shows the projected frequency of what NOAA calls <a href="http://coralreefwatch-satops.noaa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleaching Alert Level 2 Events</a> for the 2030s and 2050s. (Specifically, it shows the percentage of years in each decade in which these events will likely occur.) A Bleaching Alert Level 2 Event indicates intense heat stress and a likelihood that the corals will die.

                  The brighter the color, the more frequently these events are likely to occur. So, that wash of yellow and green that spreads across the map? It signifies a dramatic rise in both the range and frequency of the most severe levels of bleaching if carbon emissions continue unchecked.

                  An analysis in WRI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/reefs-risk-revisited" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Reefs at Risk Revisited</a> report found that, under a “business-as-usual” scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, roughly half of the world’s reefs could experience enough thermal stress to induce severe bleaching in five out of ten years during the 2030s. During the 2050s, this percentage is expected to grow to more than 95 percent.
