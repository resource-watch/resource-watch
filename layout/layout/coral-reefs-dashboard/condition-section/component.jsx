            <strong>Live Hard Coral Cover</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span>
              Prior to 1998, the global average cover of live hard coral was high (&gt;30% of area)
              and stable, although the sparsity of data prior to 1998 increases uncertainty around
              this estimate. The first mass coral bleaching event in 1998 killed approximately 8% of
              the world’s coral. Between 2002 and 2009, the average global cover of hard coral
              recovered to pre-1998 levels, but between 2009 and 2018, there was a progressive loss
              amounting to 14% of the coral from the world’s reefs. This decline was primarily due
              to recurring large-scale coral bleaching events, with a frequency that prevented coral
              cover from recovering in many areas. While the influences of smaller scale
              disturbances and threats, such as coral disease, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks,
              tropical storms, overfishing, sediment, and pollution have undoubtedly played a role
              in the decline of coral reefs, their specific contributions were not assessed.{' '}

            <span>
              Prior to 2010, the global estimated average cover of algae was low (approximately 16%
              of area) and relatively stable. Since 2010, algae cover has increased by about 20%,
              mirroring the decrease in hard coral cover. Prior to 1998, there was, on average, over
              twice as much coral on the world’s reefs as algae, but that ratio has decreased to
              closer to 1.5. Transition from coral to algae dominance in a reef community reduces
              the complex 3-dimensional habitat that is essential to support high biodiversity and
              important ecosystem services—fisheries habitat and the rugged coral structure which is
              critical to reducing wave energy and protecting shorelines.&nbsp;

            Coral reefs are likely to continue to decline due to the combined pressures of warming
            and acidifying seas, coupled with the more local pressures of overfishing, destructive
            fishing, direct physical damage, sedimentation, pollution, and disease. Even if the most
            ambitious global temperature target of the Paris Agreement is met (limiting warming to
            1.5°C),{' '}

            . But coral reefs have proven to be resilient and can recover if conditions permit.
            While the world works to limit global warming, it is critical that local pressures be
