          <p>
            Mass coral bleaching has occurred around the globe, increasing in frequency and severity
            as sea temperatures have risen over time.&nbsp;Extreme bleaching events often kill
            corals outright, while less extreme events can weaken corals, reducing growth and
            reproduction, and leaving them vulnerable to disease. The time between heat stress
            events is critical for coral recovery. In addition, areas with low levels of local
            threats tend to be more resilient.{' '}
            <strong>
              Between 1985 and 2018, 87.4% of the world’s reefs experienced bleaching level heat
              stress, while 42.5% underwent severe heat stress.
