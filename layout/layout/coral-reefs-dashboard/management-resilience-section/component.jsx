            more productive than expected given local environmental and socioeconomic conditions.
            These areas were characterized by strong sociocultural institutions (such as customary
            tenure), high levels of engagement in local management, high dependence on marine
            resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as proximity to deep-water
            refuges. (The contrasting “dark spot” areas were characterized by intensive capture and
            storage technology and a recent history of environmental shocks.) The bright spots
            analysis approach can be used to inform the types of investments and governance
            structures that can help to sustain coral reefs (e.g. participatory management and
            improved property rights).

              protection. The areas vary in size, and are often included due to one or more of
              several characteristics: a special abundance or diversity of species; unusual, rare,
              threatened or endemic species; importance as a migration corridor or spawning ground;
              significant historical, cultural or spiritual value; or particular economic importance
